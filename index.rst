MoveIt 2 Tutorials
===================

Welcome to the unified MoveIt documentation, which includes tutorials, how-to-guides, core concepts, and more.

MoveIt 2 is the robotics manipulation platform for ROS 2, and incorporates the latest advances in motion planning, manipulation, 3D perception, kinematics, control, and navigation. MoveIt 2 was first release in 2019; for ROS 1 documentation, see `MoveIt 1 tutorials <https://ros-planning.github.io/moveit_tutorials>`_.

MoveGroup - ROS Wrappers in C++
------------------------------------------
The simplest way to use MoveIt through scripting is using the ``move_group_interface``. This interface is ideal for beginners and provides unified access to many of the features of MoveIt.

Using MoveIt Directly Through the C++ API
------------------------------------------
Building more complex applications with MoveIt often requires developers to dig into MoveItâ€™s C++ API. As an added plus, using the C++ API directly skips many of the ROS Service/Action layers resulting in significantly faster performance.

Integration with a New Robot
----------------------------
Before attempting to integrate a new robot with MoveIt 2, check whether your robot has already been setup (see the `list of robots running MoveIt <http://moveit.ros.org/robots/>`_). Otherwise, follow the tutorials in this section to integrate your robot with MoveIt (and share your results on the MoveIt mailing list)
